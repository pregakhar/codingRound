`Code Review:`
1. Instead of Thread.sleep, use **explicit** and **implicit** wait.
2. Don't use hard coded path in String.
3. Take **Screenshot** if there is exception in Test.
4. Use more annotation, it will make elements more reusable.
5. Use property for driver path
6. We should create classes for each page which will make code more reusable and maintainable.
7. If we have bulk test cases, we should use Selenium Grid for parallel execution.
